- **Follow the coding style** used by the project.
- **Include tests** that cover your changes.
- **Ensure the test suite passes** and your code is linted.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- **Use the present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

- For grammar changes, use a prefix like `Grammar:` in your commit message (e.g., `Grammar: Add support for ternary operator`).
- **Limit the first line to 72 characters or less**.
- **Reference issues and pull requests** liberally after the first line.

### Coding Standards

- Follow the style conventions of Rust, C++, and Swift where applicable.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and comments are clear and concise.
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes to ensure code quality.
- Follow ANTLR-specific conventions for grammar files (e.g., naming rules in lowercase for lexer rules and PascalCase for parser rules).
- Ensure your grammar rules are modular and reusable wherever possible.
