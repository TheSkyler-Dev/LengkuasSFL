# The LengkuasSFL Scripting Language
LengkuasSFL or simply Lengkuas is an open source, embedded domain specific scripting language for real-time sensor stream filtering and setting measurement scope limits in sensor systems like for example TinyML with sensor fusion.

## The `LenguasSFL` Philosophy
LengkuasSFL aims to follow the following key characteristics:
- Concise and easily readable
- Prototyping and production in one single language
- Can be interpreted or cpmpiled
- Controlled Concurrency without surprises
- Memory safety thanks to enforced reference counting
- easy to grasp, easy to maintain structure
- FIFO (First-In, First-Out) for staggered data streams

## Who or what is `LengkuasSFL` for?
LengkuasSFL is intended for sensor systems, embedded sensor fusion with TinyML and the engineers and developers working with these technologies. LengkuasSFL can, for example, be used to filter out sensor noise or limit the measurement scope of sensors. It's **not** recommended for beginners to Programming, due to heavy use of low-level concepts like explicit state management, reference counting memory management, pointers and asynchronous operations.
