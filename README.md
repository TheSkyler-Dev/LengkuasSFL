# The LengkuasSFL Scripting Language
LengkuasSFL or simply Lengkuas is an open source, embedded domain specific scripting language for real-time sensor stream filtering and setting measurement scope limits in sensor systems like for example TinyML with sensor fusion.

## The `LenguasSFL` Philosophy
LengkuasSFL aims to follow the following key characteristics:
- Concise and easily readable
- Prototyping and production in one single language
- Can be interpreted or cpmpiled
- Controlled Concurrency without surprises
- Memory safety thanks to enforced reference counting
- easy to grasp, easy to maintain structure
- FIFO (First-In, First-Out) for staggered data streams
