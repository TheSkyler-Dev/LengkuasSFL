### Why `LengkuasSFL`?
LengkuasSFL (Lengkuas Sensor Filter Language) is a refernce to the Greater Galangal root and, beyond the "SFL" suffix, has no direct technical link to programming.

### Design Philosophy
LengkuasSFL is a procedural language. Although certain syntax may *look* object-oriented (e.g. `MySensor.temp(celsius)`), it is **purely syntactic sugar**. Under the hood, such expressions are rewritten by the compiler as regular function calls:
```
MySensor.temp(celcius)
~becomes:
temp(MySensor, celcius)
```
This keeps Lengkuas deterministic and efficient while improving readability.

### Style Guidelines
There are style recommendations for coding in LengkuasSFL, such as using four spaces for indentation, instead of tab. Semicolons may be omitted at the end of a statement, but adding them anyway is acceptable. Semicolons are required in `for`loop expressions. It is highly recommended to keep spaces between values or variables and operators. Function names should use `camelCase` or `Snake_Case`, variables can use `PascalCase`, `Kebab-Case` or ideally `lowercase`. Variables must be initialized upon declaration

### Data Types and Variables
`LengkuasSFL` has two kinds of data types: Primitives and sensor stream. Primitives are your usual data types:

| Primitives             | Special Types           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| String (`str`)         | Sensor Stream `sstream` |
| Boolean (`bool`)       |                         |
| Integer (`i32`, `i64`) |                         |
| Float (`f32`, `f64`)   |                         |

Variables have no special declaration keyword, while constants use the standard `const` keyword. Variable declaration should look something like this:
```LengkuasSFL
f64 MyVar = 9.81
const f64 pi = 3.141593
```
Variables in `LengkuasSFL` are always nullable. Since variables must be initialized upon declaration, you'd use the `nil` value for a variable with an initial null value, which prevents the variable from being used anywhere until it gets a non-null value. This cannot be done with constants. Sensor streams (`sstream`) are special variables that give a sensor address or data pins connected to a sensor a name that can be called more easily. These enable you to handle sensor data streams more gracefully by eliminating the need to specify the address or data pin of a sensor each time you want to pass its data stream to a function or array. It's important to note that a variable of type `sstream`, while technically nullable, will only accept hardware addresses (GPIO Pins, UART, I²C) upon declaration and must be declare with such.
Usage:
```LengkuasSFL
sstream MySensor = <sensor address or connected GPIO pin>
```
Example using a GPIO pin:
```LengkuasSFL
sstream MySensor = GPIO_PIN_17
```
Example using an I2C address:
```LengkuasSFL
sstream MySensor = 0x21
```


### Basic I/O
Basic I/O is essential to take any input and output text, especially for debugging. LengkuasSFL uses `msgIn()` for input and `msgOut()` for this. The text body (whatever is placed in the parentheses) of `msgOut()` automatically goes into a newline at the end. Template literals are also supported by placing a dollar sign (`$`) in front of a variable or function name. Expressions are inserted by wrapping them in curly braces preceded by a dollar sign. String literals (used as the output of `msgOut()`) must always be enclosed in double quotes `"`, single quotes are reserved for punctuation within string literals. Comments use the tilde (`~`) prefix, double tilde (`~~`) for multi-line comments.

Example usage:
```LengkuasSFL
msgIn(var)
msgOut("Hello World!")
msgOut("Variable var has value $var")
msgOut("Math expression 9 + 10 = ${9 + 10}")
```

### Data Structures 
LengkuasSFL only has two data structures as of now: Arrays and Dictionaries. They can store a bunch of data at once. Arrays are simply declared by adding the `arr` keyword in the declaration. Something like this:
```LengkuasSFL
f64 arr MyArray = [0.5, 0.49, ...]
```
It's important to note that higher dimensional arrays may be added in a later version of LengkuasSFL. 
Arrays can be null initially, which would make them unusable until data is pushed to the array. The first push to an array initialized with `nil` always overwrites the `nil` position, which would always be at index 0, since arrays in LengkuasSFL are zero-based. New data is pushed to an array with `push()`, and deleted with `pop()`. Here's an example:
```LengkuasSFL
sstream MySensor = 0x21
f64 arr MyArr = [nil]
MyArr.push(MySensor) ~pushing a sensor stream to myArr

~deleting from an array
MyArr.pop([<index>])
```
Todeclare a dictionary, which stores data as key-value pairs and is useful for associating multiple sensors to their respective sensor IDs and sensor/filter function configuration.
these use the `dict` keword and key-value-pairs are enclosed in curly braces. for a dictionary to take data of any type, the `any` keyword is used. Something like this:
```LengkuasSFL
f64 dict MyDict = {"sensor_A_ID": nil, "sensor_B_ID": nil}
```
or for filter configurations:
```LengkuasSFL
any dict config = {"window_size": 5, "window_type": "samples"}
```

### Basic Arithmetic and Logic Operators
LengkuasSFL includes a straightforward, basic set of arithmetic operators and functions for commonly used arithmetic operations, as well as the basic logic operators.

**Table of Available Arithmetic Operators**

| Operator | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | Addition       |
| `-`      | Subtraction    |
| `*`      | Multiplication |
| `/`      | Division       |
| `%`      | Modulo         |

**Table of Available Logic Operators**

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `&&`     | AND         |
| `\|\|`   | OR          |
| `!`      | NOT         |

**Table of functions for commonly used arithmetic**

| Function | Description                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `avg()`  | Calculate an average from the last second of the data stream passed to it. |
| `rnd()`  | Rounds numbers to nth decimal position (adjustable)                        |

### Control Flow
LengkuasSFL has your usual control flow structures: `while` loops, `do/while` loops and `for` loops. And both `if/else` and `switch` (declared with the `sw`keyword) statements. These are used no differently from other programming languages, but are delimited with `endwhile`, `endfor`, `endif` and `endsw`:
**While loop**
```LengkuasSFL
while(<condition>):
    ~some code here
endwhile
```
**Do/While**
```LengkuasSFL
do:
    ~code here, executes at least once before condition is checked
enddo while(<condition>)
```
**For loop**
```LengkuasSFL
for(i32 i = 0; i < len(MyArray); i++):
    ~code here
endfor
```
**If/Else**
```LengkuasSFL
if(<condition>):
    ~some code here
elif(<condition>):
    ~different code here
else:
    ~more code
endif
```
**Switch**
```LengkuasSFL
sw(<checking variable>):
    case 1
    {
        ~case 1 code
    }
    case 2
    {
        ~case 2 code
    }
    default
    {
        ~default case code
    }
endsw
```
### Functions
Functions in LengkuasSFL are a core component for writing modular, reusable code. A LengkuasSFL program must always have one main function, which is the standard entry point. The return type is specified after the function name with the arrow operator (`->`). Valid return types are all primitives, `sstream` and  `none`. The return keyword in LengkuasSFL is `ret`. To declare a function, you use the `fun` keyword, and terminate it with 'endfun`.
In LengkuasSFL, functions are declared as follows:
```LengkuasSFL
fun myFunc(<args>)->i32:
    ~some code here
    ret 0
endfun

```

### Asynchronous Operations
LengkuasSFL, by its very nature of its specific domain, of course supports asynchronous execution. To start an asynchronous block, you use the `desync` keyword and the `resync` keyword to end an asynchronous block. The equivalent to the `await` keyword is `expect` in LengkuasSFL. Here's an example:
```LengkuasSFL
desync myAsyncFunc(MySensor) -> f64:
    ~async logic here
    ret FilteredData
resync
expect f64 res = sensorFilter()
```
Important note: Asynchronous blocks are a distinct type of functions in LengkuasSFL!

### Error Handling
Error handling in LengkuasSFL is fundamentally no different from other programming languages, using the classic `try...catch` statement. Here's an example:
```LengkuasSFL
try:
    ~some code here
catch:
    throw(errMsg("Error message here", prefix -> ecode()))
endtry
```

### Pointer References
Pointer references play a crucial role in memory management, debugging and low-level memory references to variables and data structures. LengkuasSFL uses the caret (`^`) for pointers. While LengkuasSFL primarily uses reference counting, it allows for some manual memory management and is also useful for exposing parts of the program to the Foreign Function Interface built into LengkuasSFL to allow custom functions to be called externally in a C/C++ or other externam program or system if necessary.

## A Deeper Dive into LengkuasSFL `stdlib`
LengkuasSFL, as a domain-specific language, of course has some more specific features than the basics discussed above (which are also all part of the standard library). The LengkuasSFL standard library (stdlib) provides a set of built-in functions and keywords for sensor preprocessing, filtering, and communication.
It is designed to be lightweight, deterministic, and embedded-friendly while keeping code self-documenting and expressive.

### Chaining and readability
Most stdlib functions can be chained for clarity.
Chaining is **syntactic sugar**, internally desugared into nested function calls:
```lengkuas
TempSensor.temp(celcius).limits(0,100).rnd(2)
→ rnd(limits(temp(TempSensor, celcius), 0, 100), 2)
```
This feature keeps code readable and self-documenting without introducing true object orientation.

### Planned Extensions
- `calibrate(<sstream>, <config dict>)` — apply calibration constants or offsets
- `event(<sstream>)` — asynchronous event listener for sensor triggers 
- `fft(<array>)` — simple frequency domain transform (for richer signals)
